## Links

* [TryHackMe](www.Tryhackme.com) is a great resource for beginners. There are both paid and a free tiers, with the team at THM making the majority of the content available with the free tier. The main selling point of the paid tier is that you will have the ability to run multiple Virtual Machines's (VM) and AttackBoxes in succession without requiring a cooldown period.
* [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/) is another great free resource, akin to HackTheBox, Vulnerable VM's are provided for setup within your homelab or hacking environment. The VulnHub team has created guides and other resources that can also assist you on your journey!
* [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org/) is a freely available online Capture The Flag (CTF) created by the Carnegie Mellon University Security team. While this is targeted towards High Schooler's, it is also a great resource for anyone to start out. The PicoGym will allow you to access content from previous years and practice and learn in a non-competitive space.
