## Links
* [TryHackMe](tryhackme.com) is a great resource for beginners. There are both paid and a free tiers, with the team at THM making the majority of the content available with the free tier. The main selling point of the paid tier is that you will have the ability to run multiple Virtual Machines's (VM) and AttackBoxes in succession without requiring a cooldown period. AB->I
* [The Cyber Mentor - Academy](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/courses) is a wonderfully generous professional in the CyberSecurity space. TCM started his courses on Udemy before moving to his own online academy, and recently has created his own security certification - Practical Network Penetration Tester Certification. AB->I
* [Udemy](www.udemy.com) is one of the leading online learning platforms. All content is is created and uploaded by the professionals in that space. There are many great creators on the platform but I always recommend to sort by the most popular as it will have the most students, and also cross check with highest rated.
