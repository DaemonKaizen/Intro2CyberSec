* TryHackMe is a great resource for beginners. There are both paid and a free tiers, with the team at THM making the majority of the content available with the free tier. The main selling point of the paid tier is that you will have the ability to run multiple Virtual Machines's (VM) and AttackBoxes in succession without requiring a cooldown period. AB->I
* [The Cyber Mentor - Academy](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/courses) is a wonderfully generous professional in the CyberSecurity space.
