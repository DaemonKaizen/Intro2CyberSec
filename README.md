## What is this repo?

This repository is meant to act as a live collection of learning materials found online to assist those looking to learn or break into Cyber Security. much of this information has been curated from other various lists found here on GitHub, threads on Twitter, and posts from Reddit. I will do my best to ensure that all links that are listed within this repo will be credited to the original poster.

## Free Material

In this section, all material will be freely available no matter the format (video, course, blogpost, etc.). The materials will range from beginner friendly to more advanced. 

## Paid Material

In this section, all material will require either a one-time purchase or a recurring subscription to access. Udemy has a wealth of information within the classes found on there. I may look into a way of updating this on the fly or another file with links to courses with an active coupon code so the classes can be purchased at a discount.

## Hands-On Material

In this section, all material will allow for hands-on learning via cloud-based Virtual Machines, coursework allowing you to follow along, and local machine VM's to complete tasks and modules.
